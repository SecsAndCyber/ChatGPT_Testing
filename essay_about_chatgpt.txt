The rise of AI language models such as ChatGPT presents new and complex challenges to academic integrity, as traditional methods of detection and prevention become obsolete and the ability to generate convincing plagiarism becomes readily accessible. Protecting the authenticity of academic work requires a rethinking of current practices and the development of new technologies and processes to ensure the credibility of knowledge in an era of advanced artificial intelligence.
1. Improved Efficiency and Productivity: The use of AI language models such as ChatGPT can significantly enhance the speed and efficiency of the writing process, allowing authors to focus on the content and conceptualization of their work, rather than spending time on routine writing tasks.

2. Enhanced Accessibility and Inclusivity: AI language models have the potential to provide individuals who may face challenges with writing, such as non-native speakers or individuals with disabilities, with equal access to the writing and publishing process. The use of AI language models can enable authors to express their ideas and perspectives without the limitations imposed by language or physical abilities.
