The rise of AI language models such as ChatGPT presents new and complex challenges to academic integrity, as traditional methods of detection and prevention become obsolete and the ability to generate convincing plagiarism becomes readily accessible. Protecting the authenticity of academic work requires a rethinking of current practices and the development of new technologies and processes to ensure the credibility of knowledge in an era of advanced artificial intelligence.

The use of AI language models such as ChatGPT in writing has several benefits. Firstly, it can significantly improve efficiency and productivity for authors, enabling them to focus more on the content and conceptualization of their work instead of spending time on routine writing tasks. Secondly, AI language models have the potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity for individuals who may face challenges with writing such as non-native speakers or those with disabilities. They can provide equal access to the writing and publishing process and enable authors to express their ideas and perspectives without language or physical limitations.
